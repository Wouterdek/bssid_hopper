# BSSID Hopper
Windows tool to choose which specific Wi-Fi access point to connect to.

Each wifi network consists of one SSID and one or more BSSIDs.
When choosing a Wi-Fi network to connect to, you will see a list of SSIDs.
After selecting a network, Windows will automatically choose a BSSID in the network to connect to.
Each BSSID roughly corresponds to one access point device.

If you want to manually choose the access point device to connect to, this is the tool for you.

Usage: run the executable in cmd. The tool will prompt you for information when needed.
If you want the tool to automatically choose the best alternative to the current connection, use the `-a` parameter.
